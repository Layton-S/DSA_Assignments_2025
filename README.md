# Asset Management REST API

This project is a Ballerina-based REST API for managing institutional assets such as laboratory equipment, vehicles, and servers. It connects to a MySQL database for persistence and provides CRUD operations for assets, components, schedules, work orders, and tasks.

## Features

- Manage Assets (add, update, delete, list all, filter by faculty, list overdue)
- Manage Components associated with assets
- Manage Schedules for maintenance
- Manage Tasks within work orders
- Manage Work Orders
- MySQL-backed persistence layer
- Modular structure (server + client separation)

---

## Configuration

Edit `server/database_connector.bal` with your database credentials:

```ballerina
final mysql:Client db = check new (
    host = "localhost",
    user = "root",
    password = "password",
    port = 3306,
    database = "tutorial"
);
```

---

## Running the Project

### Start the Server

```bash
cd server
bal run
```

Server runs on: `http://localhost:3000/api`

### Run the Client

```bash
cd client
bal run
```
